            We will write a translator for Wink Light Bulbs. If you want to look at the end result, you can find it in the translators
            repo. Here we will code it step by step.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything we are doing here applies to other hardware as well, but Wink has an easy to use API that we will use in our translator.
            Here's what you need to follow along:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wink Hub: <a href="http://wink.com">http://wink.com</a>

                <li>Any light bulb supported by Wink, properly paired to the hub. We are using the GE Link bulb:
                    <a href="http://www.gelinkbulbs.com/">http://www.gelinkbulbs.com/</a> which is a Zigbee device. Set up
                    and make sure you can control the bulb from the Wink app, ensuring that it is properly paired with the
                    Wink hub over Zigbee.
                </li>

                <li>Familiarize yourself with the Wink API as documented on: <a href="http://docs.wink.apiary.io/">http://docs.wink.apiary.io/</a>.
                    You will notice that if you have an access token and device id, you can send a power state command to
                    the light bulb to turn it on or off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will need to contact Wink and get a Client ID and Client Secret, which are required to use the API, and are unique to
                    each client.
                </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Armed with this information and setup, let's write the translator. We provide a handy yeoman starter that scaffolds out a
            translator for you. You can read more about yeoman at yeoman.io.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, install Yeoman and generator-opent2t using npm. Both prefer a global install.
        </p>

<pre><code>$ npm install --global yo 
$ npm install --global generator-opent2t
</code></pre>

        <p>
            <br/>Next, just use the generator to start your new translator.  Use the 'r' argument to provider the cloned translators repository.
        </p>

<pre><code>$ yo opent2t -r translators
</code></pre>
        <div class="row" align="center">
            <br />
            <img src="/assets/images/yoOpent2tGenerator.PNG" class="img-fluid getStarted-image" />
            <br />
            <h5><b>Yeoman generator output</b></h5>
            <br />
        </div>
        <p>
            <br/>The generator will ask you some questions, and stub out some code based on your answers. You can read more about
            the generator, and look at the code, at https://github.com/openT2T/generator-opent2t.
        </p>

        <p>
            The generated files will look very familiar to you since they are essentially the same as the Test Light Translator with
            minor differences:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The Manifest.xml file references the "Wink Hub" onboarding module. You can go check it out in the onboarding repo, but the
                    interesting part is that its success signal returns an access token and a device id. That's all we need
                    to talk to devices in the Wink service. We do need to tell onboarding about what kind of Wink device
                    we are trying to set up, so that it can filter down to light bulbs only. We do that by updating the generated
                    manifest to add the following parameters:
                </p>
                <pre><code>&lt;onboarding id="org.OpenT2T.Onboarding.WinkHub"&gt;
    &lt;arg name="name" value="Wink Light Bulb" /&gt;
    &lt;!-- when Wink devices are enumerated, only devices that have this id key are shown --&gt;
    &lt;arg name="idKeyFilter" value="light_bulb_id" /&gt;
&lt;/onboarding&gt;
</code></pre>
                <br/>
            </li>

            <li>The Wink Hub onboarding module implements getting the access token, enumerating devices connected to Wink, and
                letting the user select one so that we have a device id. The translator just gets all this context information
                in its initDevice method. We can run the Wink Hub onboarding module from the node command line to get the
                access token as described in its README.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You now have the starting point of your translator. You should move the generated files, with edits above, to the final place
            where you want to commit your translator. Look at the directory structure of the translators repo for guidance,
            for example all translators that implement a schema schema need to be in the directory corresponding to that
            schema.
