            Let's discuss some basic concepts about translators. A translator does exactly what you would expect: it translates between
            a schema (e.g. a generic concept of a lightbulb) and a specific thing or piece of hardware (e.g. a specific lightbulb
            that you can communicate to via a particular protocol or bus). The schema is exposed to app developers who no
            longer need to worry about how to communicate with that specific lightbulb.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            For those who learn better by example, we have some translators in the <a href="https://github.com/opent2t/translators">translators repo</a>            that you can go look at. We suggest starting with something really simple like the <a href="https://github.com/openT2T/translators/tree/master/org.OpenT2T.Sample.SuperPopular.Lamp/Test%20Light/js">
            Test Light Translator</a> which just does console logging instead of talking to a real device. You can find it
            under the
            <a href="https://github.com/openT2T/translators/tree/master/org.OpenT2T.Sample.SuperPopular.Lamp"> org.OpenT2T.Sample.SuperPopular.Lamp</a>            namespace, which corresponds to the schema for this translator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with a README and a test script, you will see some other files in the translator:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>package.json</b> We currently support translators written in node, so each translator has a package.json
                file that lists its dependencies on other node modules, versioning information, etc.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>manifest.xml</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This file defines the schema this translator is implementing, in this example org.OpenT2T.Sample.SuperPopular.Lamp.
                        This name is intentionally tongue in cheek for now and intended to stress that this is just a sample.
                        If you open the schema file, which is one level up in the tree, you will note that this is standard
                        introspection XML and defines some basic methods that a lamp might have, e.g. turning it on or off,
                        and setting its brightness.

                    </li>
                    <li>This file also defines the onboarding module for this translator. Onboarding is a generic term for any
                        setup, pairing, auth, etc. that you typically need to do before you can communicate with a device.
                        The runtime hosting the translator will provide an implementation for onboarding (e.g. some UX to
                        take user input) and the metadata for what goes in and out of onboarding of a particular type is
                        specified in the onboarding repo which we have also cloned locally. For the Test Light Translator
                        translator you will notice that the "Manual" onboarding module is being passed some data that it
                        could show to the user as they set up the device. Go check out at the "Manual" onboarding module
                        that this translator is referring to in the onboarding repo. We will see some more complicated onboarding
                        modules later, but for now just note that this is standard introspection XML, and the success signal
                        describes what information is passed into the translator as a result of onboarding. We have provided
                        some other sample onboarding modules and hope to add more with community participation.
                        
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>thingTranslator.js</b> This is a cross-platform node module that implements the schema. In this example,
                you will see turnOn, turnOff, etc. which are methods defined in the schema and implemented here. The initDevice
                method is special, and is called to initialize this translator with a device object that contains the results
                of onboarding. Since we are using Manual onboarding for this translator, you will recall that there was a
                token parameter that we can expect to exist in the props hash passed to initDevice, if onboarding was successful.
                
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In summary, a translator is something that runs after onboarding and implements a particular schema in node.js. Various onboarding
            modules are implemented in the onboarding repo, and pass in context to the translator via the initDevice method,
            e.g. any setup or auth information the translator needs to run.
